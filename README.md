# Network Analysis and Graph Theory: Exploring Marine Connectivity - Course Datasets Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the dataset repository for the course **'Network Analysis and Graph Theory: Exploring Marine Connectivity'**, an online course offered as part of the [SEA-UNICORN - COST Action CA19107](https://www.sea-unicorn.com). This repository contains all the datasets used in the practical exercises throughout the course.

The course is structured into three comprehensive parts, each with hands-on R programming sessions to ensure practical application alongside theoretical understanding.

### Course Structure:

1. **Introduction to Network Analysis and Graph Theory**
   - Fundamentals of topology and graph theory
   - Basic theory of graphs, their types, characteristics, and representations
   - Practical R exercises focused on building and analyzing graphs

2. **Analyzing Graphs**
   - Centrality measures and community detection
   - Hands-on R exercises to deepen understanding and enhance R programming skills

3. **Community Detection and Marine Connectivity Case Study**
   - Network modularity and community detection
   - Real-world and theoretical applications in marine connectivity studies
   - Challenging R exercises addressing complex problems in marine ecology

Our aim is to not only teach these concepts but also to equip you with the skills to apply them effectively in marine science and beyond.
